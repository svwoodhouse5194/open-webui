    <h1 class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-700 to-blue-800">How can I get access to the code?</h1>
    <p>NIPRGPT is a GOTS solution that can support the entire DoD. If you're interested in using the code to deploy your own Generative AI solution, please reach out to the team and we will provide you access to our repository.</p>
    <h1 class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-700 to-blue-800">I'm interested in an air-gapped deployment of NIPRGPT</h1>
    <p>NIPRGPT is a GOTS solution that you can use at your own respective shop. However it will require access to GPUs in order to optimally run the Large Language Model. Most locations that want a deployment are trying to support ~4000 users. For this, we recommend 4 NVIDIA H100 GPUs connected together using an NVIDIA NVL or 8 NVIDIA L40S GPUs. For more specifics, reach out to us and we can help provide a better estimate based on your specific requirements.</p>

    <p>Currently, our project is not funded and is based off of volunteers and existing compute resources We are in dire need of additional resources and appreciate any level of support. Our main objective is to acquire NVIDIA DGX H100s which are $450k per machine and NVIDIA L40S machines which are $100k per machine.</p>

    <p>Currently, this is an issue when you might have used NIPRGPT 1.0+ and returned back after a few days. The system is trying to use an old session token which is stale and no longer active. To fix this, select your name icon in the top right-hand corner of NIPRGPT 1.0+ and select "Logout". This should fix the problem.</p>
